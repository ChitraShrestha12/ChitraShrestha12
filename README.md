# 👋 Hi there!

I'm **Chitra Shrestha**, a frontend developer focused on crafting **clean, fast, and functional UIs** 👨‍💻

I build **responsive**, **user-friendly** websites using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **React**.  
I love turning creative ideas into smooth, fast interfaces that look great on any screen.

Outside of coding, I enjoy **watching anime**, **gaming**, and **exploring fantasy and historical series like *The Witcher*, *Vikings: Valhalla*, and *The Wheel of Time***.
