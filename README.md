# 👋 Hi there!

I'm **Chitra Shrestha**, a frontend developer with a love for **pixel-perfect design** 👨‍💻

I build **responsive**, **user-friendly** websites using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **React**.  
I love turning creative ideas into smooth, fast interfaces that look great on any screen.

Outside of coding, I enjoy **watching anime**, **gaming** and **learning new tech**.
